App for checking where you stand in income for your area.

## Description
User puts in their state, county, and income, then guessed what percentile they fall in.
The app pulls data from the [http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs1/profile.html](US Census American Community Survey API) to display a D3 graph of the income distribution with markers for their percentile and their guess.

## Todos
- Make markers more robust so they don't overlap
- Save user guesses in db
